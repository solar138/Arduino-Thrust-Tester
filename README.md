# Arduino-Thrust-Tester
Controls a PWM-based ESC connected to a BLDC ducted fan along with taking measurements from an IR optical sensor. Allows simultaneous measurement of thrust, RPM, and PWM duty cycle to put together a graph. Runs fully automatically apart from initial load cell calibration. Designed for an Arduino UNO R4 Wi-Fi, though other boards should work.
